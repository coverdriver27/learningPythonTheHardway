Exercise 9: Printing, Printing, Printing
By now you should realize the pattern for this book is to use more than one exercise to teach you something new.
I start with code that you might not understand, then more exercises explain the concept. If you don't understand
something now, you will later as you complete more exercises. Write down what you don't understand, and keep going.

# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

print("Here are the days: ", days)
print("Here are the months: ", months)

print("""
There's something going on here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
