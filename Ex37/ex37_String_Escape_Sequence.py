This program uses escape characters in a string to print out examples of each of the characters you listed. The escape 
characters are denoted by the backslash () followed by a letter or symbol, such as \ for a backslash, ' for a single 
quote, and " for a double quote. The program prints out each example on a new line using the print function.
