What you should see -->

$ python3.6 ex6.py
There are 10 types of people.
Those who know binary and those who don't.
I said: There are 10 types of people.
I also said: 'Those who know binary and those who don't.'
Isn't that joke so funny?! False
This is the left side of...a string with a right side.


Study Drills

Go through this program and write a comment above each line explaining it.
  >> Done

Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.
  >> Done

Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.
  >> Done

Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.
  >> Because it was previously defined/Set to a string before printing out the lines

Break It

You are now at a point where you can try to break your code to see what happens.
Think of this as a game to devise the most clever way to break the code. You can also find the simplest way to break it.
Once you break the code, you then need to fix it. If you have a friend, then the two of you can try to break each other's code and fix it.
Give your friend your ex6.py file so they can break something. Then you try to find their error and fix it.
Have fun with this, and remember that if you wrote this code once you can do it again.
If you take your damage too far, you can always type it in again for extra practice.
