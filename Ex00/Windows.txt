1. Go to https://atom.io with your browser, get the Atom text editor, and install it. You do not need
to be the administrator to do this.
2. Make sure you can get to Atom easily by putting it on your desktop and/or in Quick Launch. Both
options are available during setup.
(a) If you cannot run Atom because your computer is not fast enough, then see Alternative Text
Editors at the end of this exercise.
3. Run PowerShell from the Start menu. Search for it, and you can just press Enter to run it.
4. Make a shortcut to it on your desktop and/or Quick Launch for your convenience.
5. Run your PowerShell program (which I will call Terminal later). It won’t look like much.
6. Download Python 3.6 from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/ and install it.
Be sure to check the box that says to add Python 3.6 to your path.
28 LEARN PYTHON 3 THE HARD WAY
7. In your PowerShell (Terminal) program, run python. You run things in Terminal by just typing
the name and pressing Enter.
(a) If you type python and it does not run, then you have to reinstall Python and make sure you
check the box for ”Add python to the PATH.” It’s very small so look carefully.
8. Type quit(), and press Enter to exit python.
9. You should be back at a prompt similar to what you had before you typed python. If not, find
out why.
10. Learn how to make a directory in the PowerShell (Terminal).
11. Learn how to change into a directory in the PowerShell (Terminal).
12. Use your editor to create a file in this directory. Make the file, Save or Save As..., and pick this
directory.
13. Go back to PowerShell (Terminal) using just the keyboard to switch windows. Look it up if you
can’t figure it out.
14. Back in PowerShell (Terminal), list the directory to see your newly created file.
From now on, when I say ”Terminal” or ”shell” I mean PowerShell, and that’s what you should use.
When I run python3.6 you can just type python.

It is still correct if you see different information than mine, but yours should be similar.
