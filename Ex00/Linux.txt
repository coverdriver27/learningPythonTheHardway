Linux
Linux is a varied operating system with many different ways to install software. I’m assuming if you are
running Linux then you know how to install packages, so here are your instructions:
1. Use your package manager to install Python 3.6, and if you can’t, then download source from
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/ and build from source.
2. Use your Linux package manager, and install the Atom text editor. If Atom does not suite you,
then see Alternative Text Editors at the end of this exercise.
3. Make sure you can get to Atom easily by putting it in your window manager’s menu.
4. Find your Terminal program. It could be called GNOME Terminal, Konsole, or xterm.
5. Put your Terminal in your dock as well.
6. Run your Terminal program. It won’t look like much.
7. In your Terminal program, run python3.6. You run things in Terminal by just typing the command name and pressing Enter. If you can’t run python3.6, try running just python.
8. Type quit() and press Enter to exit python.
9. You should be back at a prompt similar to what you had before you typed python. If not, find
out why.
10. Learn how to make a directory in Terminal.
11. Learn how to change into a directory in Terminal.
12. Use your editor to create a file in this directory. Typically, you will make the file, Save or Save
As..., and pick this directory.
13. Go back to Terminal using just the keyboard to switch windows. Look it up if you can’t figure it
out.
14. Back in Terminal, list the directory to see your newly created file.

It is still correct if you see different information than mine, but yours should be similar
